# The frequency lexicon of Quranic letters
# الْمُعْجَم الترددي لِلْحُرُوف فِي الْقُرْآنِ 

In this project, we count frequencies of Arabic letters based on any [alphabetical systems](https://hci-lab.github.io/PyQuran-Private/arabic_tools/#alphabetical-systems-definitions) you define. This is a direct GUI application using the library [PyQuran](https://github.com/hci-lab/PyQuran), designed for researchers of Quranic and Arabic studies who do not have programming skills to use [PyQuran](https://github.com/hci-lab/PyQuran).

# How to use
It supports multiple filtrations based on:
* Surah
* Aya
* Characters

So it allows you to apply any sort of filtration in order to fit your search aspects.

For character filtration, you can choose a single character or a combination of characters, and it will consider those combined characters as single letter (e.g ة,ت == one-letter). This allows you to create any system according to your use-case.

After customizing the filtration setting, hit the add button to get the results.
![Append button](./images/img5.png)

You will get all character shapes of frequency (with-tashkeel and without) according to your filtration settings.
